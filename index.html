      <p>This page is a canvas.</p>
      <p>You can select three points by clicking anywhere on a canvas.</p>
      <p>As they are selected, the program highlights their location by drawing red circles, 11 pixels in diameter,
        centered on each selected point.</p>
        <p>Based on these three points, two additional shapes are drawn:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            - a blue parallelogram, having three of its corners in the points selected by the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            - a yellow circle, with the same area and centre of mass as the parallelogram.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The coordinates of the selected points in pixels as well as the area of the parallelogram and circle are presented.
          You are free to move around the points. This makes the parallelogram, circle and printed information update
          accordingly.</p>
          <p>There is also a “reset” feature that clears the board and lets you select three new points, repeating the
            process described above. </p>
